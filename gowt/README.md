## Usage

### Run tests with live TUI

`Gowt` wraps `go test` and provides a live TUI for viewing test results. You can pass any `go test` flags and specify packages as usual: 

```bash
# Run all tests in current directory
gowt ./...

# Run tests in a specific package
gowt ./pkg/mypackage/...

# Run with verbose flag
gowt -v ./...

# Run with any go test flags
gowt -race -count=1 ./...
```

### Load saved test results

You can also view previously saved test results:

```bash
# Save test results to a file
go test -json ./... > results.json

# View saved results
gowt --load results.json
gowt -l results.json
```
