● Creating a VS Code Extension - Summary

  Quick Steps

  1. Install Prerequisites
  npm install -g yo generator-code
  2. Scaffold the Extension
  yo code
  2. Choose: TypeScript or JavaScript, extension name, etc.
  3. Project Structure
  my-extension/
  ├── package.json      # Extension manifest (commands, activation events)
  ├── src/
  │   └── extension.ts  # Main entry point (activate/deactivate functions)
  └── tsconfig.json
  4. Develop & Test
    - Press F5 in VS Code to launch Extension Development Host
    - Make changes, reload window to test
  5. Package & Publish (optional)
  npm install -g vsce
  vsce package        # Creates .vsix file
  vsce publish        # Publishes to marketplace

  Workspace-Only Extension

  Yes, you can! Two approaches:

  Option 1: Local .vsix Installation (Recommended for private use)

  1. Package your extension: vsce package
  2. Install only in this workspace via command palette: Extensions: Install from VSIX...
  3. The extension is installed globally but you control where you use it

  Option 2: Workspace Folder Extension (Development mode)

  Put your extension in .vscode/extensions/ folder of your workspace and run in debug mode. However, VS Code doesn't natively support "workspace-scoped" extensions.

  Option 3: Activation Condition

  In package.json, use activationEvents to only activate when specific files/folders exist:
  {
    "activationEvents": [
      "workspaceContains:**/go-rukita-be/**"
    ]
  }

  This way the extension only activates when it detects it's in your specific workspace.

> Okay, so can we develop first in .vscode/extensions/ - then after everything is working, publish? 

● Yes, You Can - Here's the Workflow

  Development in Workspace

  You can develop locally, but not directly in .vscode/extensions/ - that folder is for installed extensions. Instead:

  Recommended Local Development Setup

  go-rukita-be/
  ├── .vscode/
  │   └── my-extension/        # Your extension source here
  │       ├── package.json
  │       ├── src/
  │       │   └── extension.ts
  │       └── tsconfig.json

  Development Workflow

  1. Create the extension folder
  mkdir -p .vscode/my-extension
  cd .vscode/my-extension
  yo code   # or manually create files
  2. Develop & Test
    - Open .vscode/my-extension folder in a separate VS Code window
    - Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
    - Your main workspace opens with the extension loaded
  3. When Ready to Publish
  cd .vscode/my-extension
  vsce package    # Creates my-extension-0.0.1.vsix
  vsce publish    # Publish to marketplace
  4. Or move to separate repo
  mv .vscode/my-extension ~/projects/my-extension
  cd ~/projects/my-extension
  git init
  # ... continue development there

  Quick Tip

  Add to .gitignore if you don't want to commit the extension source:
  .vscode/my-extension/

> When I launch Extension Development Host, all my other VsCode windows suddenly have the extension installed?
So I can develop in another VsCode window, but test the extension in this workspace? 

● No - It's Sandboxed

  The Extension Development Host is isolated. Here's how it works:

  ┌─────────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────────┐
  │  VS Code Window 1           │     │  Extension Dev Host         │
  │  (Your extension source)    │     │  (Test window)              │
  │                             │     │                             │
  │  - Edit extension code      │ F5  │  - Your extension ACTIVE    │
  │  - Extension NOT active     │ ──► │  - Opens your workspace     │
  │  - Normal VS Code           │     │  - Sandboxed instance       │
  └─────────────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────────────┘

  ┌─────────────────────────────┐
  │  VS Code Window 2, 3, etc   │
  │  (Other projects)           │
  │                             │
  │  - Extension NOT installed  │
  │  - Completely unaffected    │
  └─────────────────────────────┘

  Your Workflow

  Yes, exactly what you described:

  1. Window A: Open extension folder (.vscode/my-extension/) - write code here
  2. Press F5: Opens Extension Development Host
  3. Dev Host Window: Opens go-rukita-be workspace with your extension running
  4. Test the extension in the Dev Host
  5. Make changes in Window A → Reload Dev Host (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

  Your other VS Code windows remain completely unaffected. The extension only exists in the Dev Host until you package and install it
